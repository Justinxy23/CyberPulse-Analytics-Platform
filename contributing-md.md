# Create a new migration
alembic revision -m "Add new column to security_events"

# Apply migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Rollback one migration
alembic downgrade -1
```

## Style Guidelines

### Python Style Guide

We follow PEP 8 with these additions:
- Line length: 120 characters
- Use type hints for function parameters and returns
- Docstrings for all public functions (Google style)

```python
def calculate_risk_score(
    event: SecurityEvent,
    threat_intel: Dict[str, Any],
    ml_model: Optional[Model] = None
) -> float:
    """Calculate risk score for a security event.
    
    Args:
        event: The security event to analyze
        threat_intel: Threat intelligence data
        ml_model: Optional ML model for scoring
        
    Returns:
        Risk score between 0.0 and 1.0
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If event data is invalid
    """
    # Implementation
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript Style Guide

- Use ESLint configuration
- Prefer functional components in React
- Use TypeScript for new code

### SQL Style Guide

- Use UPPERCASE for SQL keywords
- Use snake_case for table and column names
- Add comments for complex queries

```sql
-- Get recent high-severity events
SELECT 
    e.event_id,
    e.source_ip,
    e.severity,
    COUNT(a.alert_id) AS alert_count
FROM 
    security_events e
    LEFT JOIN security_alerts a ON e.event_id = a.event_id
WHERE 
    e.severity IN ('HIGH', 'CRITICAL')
    AND e.timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY 
    e.event_id, e.source_ip, e.severity
ORDER BY 
    alert_count DESC;
```
